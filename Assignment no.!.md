### In this assignment we have to give the data and the problem statement which are we solving in this:

1. E-commerce
2. Manufacturing
3. Banking
4. Healthcare
5. Transport
6. Finance

## E-Commerce:-

###### Collecting the data:

> In E-commerce , Data playes a very important role For all the sales and and product.

In this we have to collect all the data of our users that which product is in hipe and which is not and then after we can train our model so he can recommend the products according to there like and interest.
Collecting customer reviews and feedback from various sources, including websites, social media, and review platforms, can help train AI models to understand customer preferences and sentiment.Collecting product information, including descriptions, prices, and images, from various sources like manufacturer websites, product catalogs, and e-commerce platforms, can help train AI models to understand product features and characteristics.

###### Problem Statement:

> On the basic of all the data it trains a model for recommendation of products on the basic of customer interest.

In this it basically create a model which recommend product to customers on there intrest and likeness. So can we can buy what we like and or wanted it buy , By all these models only they prepare the discount on the products according to there requiremet and sale. The solution involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and selecting an appropriate recommendation algorithm such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach. Collaborative filtering leverages user-item interactions, while content-based filtering analyzes product attributes. A hybrid model combines both for better accuracy.

## Manufacturing

###### Collecting the data:

> Collecting the data of the speed and time from different-differents machines

goods. Additionally, predictive maintenance data from historical maintenance logs and operator feedback can help prevent machine failures. All this data, when collected and processed using AI/ML algorithms, enables manufacturers to optimize production efficiency, reduce waste, and improve overall quality.
Computer vision and AI-powered cameras can be used for defect detection and quality assurance by analyzing images of products. RFID and barcode scanners enable real-time tracking of raw materials and finished goods.

###### Problem Statement:

> After collecting the data from the we can just check and update the time and efforts but incresing its complexity

AI/ML models can optimize manufacturing by enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and improving quality through data-driven insights. Predictive maintenance uses machine learning to analyze sensor data from equipment, predicting failures before they happen and minimizing downtime. Computer vision models enable real-time defect detection, ensuring high product quality with greater accuracy than manual inspection. AI-driven demand forecasting helps optimize inventory, reducing waste and supply chain inefficiencies. Process automation using AI optimizes workflows, minimizing bottlenecks and improving production speed. Additionally, reinforcement learning can enhance robotic automation, leading to more precise and adaptive manufacturing operations. By integrating AI/ML, manufacturers can achieve smarter production, reduced costs, and improved overall operational efficiency

## Banking

###### Collecting the data:

> Data collection for bank is also an important so that we can use share the details so that it could judge the civil score of all of there customes

To collect data for a banking model, institutions use multiple sources, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. Transactional data, including deposits, withdrawals, and online payments, is gathered from customer accounts to analyze spending patterns. Customer demographics, such as age, income, and employment status, help in credit risk assessment and personalized services. Loan and credit history data from internal records and credit bureaus provide insights for lending decisions. Fraud detection systems collect real-time transaction logs, device fingerprints, and behavioral patterns to identify anomalies. Customer interactions from chatbots, call centers, and feedback forms help enhance service quality. Web and mobile app usage data, including login frequency and browsing behavior, support personalized recommendations. By integrating these diverse data sources using AI/ML models, banks can improve risk management, fraud detection, customer engagement, and financial forecasting

###### Problem Statement:

> It takes too much time to check whether whome we should the lone and whome shoud
